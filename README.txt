        Welcome to Return to the Earth !

   This is the game Return to the Earth, by Flurrfie Games.
(Dennis Brown).   It has speech, graphics, and music. I hope
you enjoy it, and I have written short but sufficient instructions
so that you can get to the game soon.   Enjoy!
  

      Part I: Setting Up
      __________________

   If you use the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, you will have noticed some
menus. When a menu appears, type your choice and press ENTER at
the A> prompt. The menu choices have been broken into batch files,
if you're wondering. 
   The first menu will ask if you are using a PCjr or PC or compatible.
This is done because the PC and PCjr need separate speech drivers.
PCjr owners will go straight to the game. PC owners will have another
menu asking which BASIC they use. Answer this and you will start.

      Part II: Beginning
      __________________

   The program will ask you if you want speech. Reply Y or N.
Then you will see the opening screen. Press a key. Then press a
key after the credits, and you will see a menu. The choices lead
you to other menus, and most of these will give you descriptions
of various things.
   The choice "Earn Marks of Honor" will let you earn marks of honor.
Use the arrow keys to move your ship (the triangle) and pick up the
white circles and shoot the dark circles. Shot by pressing the
space bar. To make a successful hit you must hit the top of the
circle. To pick up the white circles, you must get your ship near the
"corner" of the circle.
   The choice "Make Characters" will let you make RTTE         
characters. Just follow the instructions. Most things in this game
are self-explanatory anyway.
